# go-grpc-service
This is a simple gRPC Service for inter systems communication implemented in Golang. The service implements a Server which responds to requests made by a remote Client (system). gRPC makes possible to build fast and agnostic communication between systems, and are great for constant database storage, ingestion and digestion of data, faast inter-systems communication, etc.

# Project Overview
Golang is a very fast compiled language that is great for building microservices and APIs. gRPC is a great tool for building fast and agnostic communication between systems. This project is a simple gRPC Service that implements a Server which responds to requests made by a remote Client (system). The service is a simple calculator that receives one integer each second and returns the sum as the result of the operation. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to build a simple gRPC Service in Golang.
